<section id="Introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document was developed as a result of observations by the 
Internationalization Working Group over a series of specification 
reviews related to formats based on JSON, WebIDL, and other 
non-markup data languages. Unlike markup formats, such as XML, these 
data languages generally do not provide extensible attributes and were 
not conceived with built-in language or direction metadata.</p>

<p>Natural language information on the Web depends on and benefits from 
the presence of language and direction metadata. Along with support for 
Unicode, mechanisms for including and specifying the base direction and 
the natural language of spans of text are one of the key 
internationalization considerations when developing new formats and 
technologies for the Web.</p>

<p>Markup formats, such as HTML and XML, as well as related styling 
languages, such as CSS and XSL, are reasonably mature and provide 
support for the interchange and presentation of the world's languages 
via built-in features. Data formats need similar support in order to 
ensure a complete and consistent support for the world's languages and 
cultures.</p>

	


<section id="terminology">
	<h2>Terminology</h2>
	<p>This section defines terminology necessary to understand the contents of this document. The terms defined here are specific to this document.</p>
	
  
  <p>A <dfn>producer</dfn> is any process where natural language string data is created for later storage, processing, or interchange.</p>
  <p>A <dfn>consumer</dfn> is any process that receives natural language strings, either for display or processing.</p>
  <p>An <dfn>agreement</dfn> is the common understanding between a producer and consumer about the encoding of string metadata: how it is to be understood, serialized, read, transmitted, removed, etc.</p>
 
 </section>
 
 <section id="producers_consumers">
  <h2>The String Lifecycle</h2>
  
  <p>It's not possible to consider alternatives for handling string metadata in a vacuum: we need to establish a framework for talking about string handling and data formats.</p>
  
<section id="producers">  
  <h3>Producers</h3>  
  <p>A string can be created in a number of ways, including a content author typing strings into a plain text editor, text message, or editing tool; or a script scraping text from web pages; or acquisition of an existing set of strings from another application or repository. Any source of strings might provide an interface or API that determines or allows the base direction or language to be specified at creation. It might also provide a suitable default when the direction or language is not provided or specified. In this document, the <b class="newterm">producer</b> of a string is the source, be it human or a mechanism, that creates a string for storage or transmission.</p>
  <p>When a  string is created, it's necessary to (a) detect or capture the appropriate language and base direction to be associated with the string, and (b) take steps, where needed, to set the string up in a way that stores and communicates the language and base direction.</p>
  <p>For example, in the case of a string that is extracted from an HTML form, the base direction can be detected from the computed value of the form's field. Such a value could be inherited from an earlier element, such as the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> element, or set using markup or styling on the <code class="kw" translate="no">input</code> element itself. The user could also set the direction of the text by <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-dir#userexplicit">using  keyboard shortcut keys</a> to change the direction of the form field. The <code class="kw" translate="no">dirname</code> attribute provides a way of automatically communicating that value with a form submission.</p>
  <p>Similarly, language information in an HTML form  would most likely be inherited from the <code class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> attribute on the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag, or any element in the tree with a <code class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> attribute.</p>
  <p>If the producer of the string is receiving the string from a location where it was stored by another producer, and where the base direction/language has already been established, the producer needs to understand that the language and base direction has already been set and convert or encode that information for its consumers.</p>
</section>
<section id="consumers">
  <h3>Consumers</h3>
  <p>A <b class="newterm">consumer</b> is an application or process that receives a string for processing and possibly places it into a context where it will be exposed to a user. For display purposes, it must ensure that the base direction and language of the string is correctly applied to the string in that context. For processing purposes, it must at least persist the language and direction and may need to use the language and direction data in order to perform language-specific operations.</p>
  <p>Displaying the string usually involves applying the base direction and language by constructing additional markup, adding control codes, or setting display properties. This indicates to rendering software the base direction or language that should be applied to the string in this display context to get the string to appear correctly. For text direction, it must also isolate embedded strings from the surrounding text to avoid spill-over effects of the bidi algorithm [[UAX9]]. For language, it must make clear the boundaries for the range of text to which the language applies.</p>
</section>
<section id="agreements">
  <h3>Encoding Agreements</h3>
  <p>Any time a producer of a string takes special steps to collect and communicate information about the base direction and language of that string, it must do so with the expectation that the consumer of the string will understand how the producer encoded this information. If no action is taken by the producer, the consumer must still decide what rules to follow in order to decide on the appropriate base direction and language, even if it is only to provide some form of default value.</p>
  <p>In some systems or document formats, the necessary behaviour of the producers and consumers of a string are fully specified. In others, such agreements are not available; it is up to users to provide an agreement for how to encode, transmit, and later decode the necessary language or direction informat. Low level specifications, such as JSON, do not provide a string metadata structure by default, so any document formats based on these need to provide the "agreement" themselves.</p>
</section>

<section id="Why is this important?">
<h3>Why is this important?</h3>

<p>Information about the language of content is important when processing 
and presenting natural language data for a variety of reasons. When 
language information is not present, the resulting degradation in appearance or 
functionality can frustrate users, render the content unintelligible, 
or disable important features. Some of the affected processes 
include:</p> 

<ul>
	<li>Selection of fonts and configuration of rendering options to 
	enable the proper display of different languages. This includes 
	prevention of problems such as: <ul>
		<li>"ransom noting" (showing text using multiple different fonts)</li>
		<li>language specific glyph selection,especially the selection of the correct 
	Chinese/Japanese/Korean font due to important presentational 
	variations for the same characters in these languages
		<li>displaying blanks, spaces, question marks, or other 
		disappearnace of characters due to the lack of glyphs in the 
		selected font</li> 
	</ul></li>
	<li>Spell checking and other content processing (such as abuse 
	detection, hyphenation, etc.) </li> 
	<li>Indexing, search, and other natural language 
	text operations </li> 
	<li>Filtering according to intended audience 
	and language negotiation </li>
	<li>Selection of a text-to-speech voice and processor, such as used 
	for accessibility or in a voice-based interface</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, direction metadata is important to the Web. When a string 
contains text in a script that runs right-to-left (RTL), it must be 
possible to eventually display that string correctly when it reaches an 
end user. For that to happen, it is necessary to establish what <dfn>base 
direction</dfn> needs to be applied to the string as a whole. The 
appropriate base direction cannot always be deduced by simply looking 
at the string; even if it were possible, the producer and consumer of 
the string would need to use the same heuristics to interpret its 
direction.</p>
  
<p>Static content, such as the body of a Web page or the contents of an 
e-book, often has language or direction information provided by the document format 
or as part of the content metadata. Data formats found on the Web 
generally do not supply this metadata. Base specifications such as 
Microformats, WebIDL, JSON, and more, have tended to store natural 
language text in string objects, without additional metadata.</p>

<p>This places a burden on application authors and data format 
designers to provide the metadata on their own initiative. When 
standardized formats do not address the resulting issues, the result 
can be that, while the data arrives intact, its processing or 
presentation cannot be wholly recovered.</p>

<section id="baseExample">
	<h3>An Example</h3>

<p>Suppose that you are building a Web page to show a 
customer's library of e-books. The e-books exist in a catalog of data 
and consist of the usual data values. A JSON file for a single entry 
might look something like:</p>

<pre>
{
    "id": "978-0-1234-5678-X",
    "title": "Moby Dick",
    "authors": [ "Herman Melville" ],
    "language": "en-US",
    "pubDate": "1851-10-18",
    "publisher": "Mark Twain Press",
    "coverImage": "https://example.com/images/mobidick_cover.jpg",
    // etc.
},
</pre>

<p>Each of the above is a data field in a database somewhere. There is 
even language information about the contents of the book 
(<kbd>"language": "en-US"</kbd>).</p>

<p>A well-internationalized catalog would include additional metadata 
to what is shown above. That is, for each of the fields containing 
natural language text, such as the <kbd>title</kbd> and 
<kbd>authors</kbd> fields, there should be a language attribute and base 
direction stored as metadata. (There may be other values as well, such 
as pronunciation metadata for sorting East Asian language information.) 
These metadata values are used by consumers of the data to influence the processing 
and enable the display of the items in a variety of ways. As the JSON data structure 
provides no place to store or exchange these values, it is more difficult
to construct internationalized applications.</p>

<p>One work-around might be to encode the values using a mix of HTML 
and Unicode bidi controls, so that a data value might look like one of 
the following:</p>

<pre>
   "title": "&lt;span lang='en-US' dir='ltr'&gt;Mobi Dick&lt;/span&gt;"
   "authors": [ "\u200eHerman Melville" ], // contains LRM as first character
</pre>

<p>But JSON is a data interchange format: the content might not end up 
displaying the title field in an HTML context. The JSON above might very well 
be used to populate, say, a local data store which uses native controls 
to show the title and these controls will treat the HTML as string contents. 
Producers and consumers of the data might not 
expect to introspect the data in order to supply or remove the extra data or to 
expose it as metadata. Most JSON libraries don't know anything about the structure of the content
that they are serializing. Producers want to generate the JSON file 
directly from a local data store, such as a database. Consumers want to store
or retrieve the value for use without additional consideration of the content of each string. 
In addition, either producers or consumers can have other considerations, such as 
field length restrictions, that are affected by the insertion of additional 
controls or markup. Each of these considerations places special burden on implementers
to create arbitrary means of serializing, deserializing, managing, and exchanging
the necessary metadata, with interoperability as a casualty along the way.</p> 

</section>
</section>

<section id="unicode-enough">
<h3>Isn't Unicode Enough?</h3>

<p>[[!Unicode]] and its character encodings (such as UTF-8) are key elements 
of the Web and its formats. They provide the ability to encode and 
exchange text in any language consistently throughout the Internet. 
However, Unicode by itself does not guarantee perfect presentation and 
processing of natural language text, even though it does guarantee 
perfect interchange.</p>

<p>Several features of Unicode are sometimes suggested as part of the 
solution to providing language and direction metadata. Specificially, 
Unicode bidi controls are suggested for handling direction metadata. In 
addition, there are "tag" characters in the <kbd>U+E0000</kbd> block of Unicode 
for use as language tags. These characters are deprecated and their use 
is "strongly discouraged" (to quote Unicode).</p>

<p>There are a variety of reasons why the addition of characters to 
data in an interchange format is not a good idea. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most data sources (used to assemble data files) do not contain 
  these characters; the process of assembling or serializing the data 
  will need to introspect and insert the necessary characters. Consumers must then deserialize and instrospect the information using an identical <a>agreement</a>.</li>
  <li>Many data formats have externally provided limitations on 
  content, such as length limits. Inserting additional characters into 
  the data may violate these externally applied requirements, and interfere 
  with processing. In the worst case, portions (or all of) the data value itself might be corrupted 
  or lost as a result.</li>
  <li>Inserting additional characters changes the identity of the string. This may have important consequences in certain contexts.</li>
  <li>Inserting and removing characters from the string is not a common operation for most data serialization libraries. Any processing that adds language or direction controls would need to introspect the string to see if these are already present or might need to do other processing to insert or modify the contents of the string as part of serializing the data.</li>
</ul>

<section id="Language Identification">
  <h2>Language Identification</h2>
<section id="Definitions">
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p><dfn id="langmeta">Language metadata</dfn> typically indicates the 
intended linguistic audience or user of the resource as a whole, and 
it's possible to imagine that this could, for a multilingual resource, 
involve a property value that is a list of languages. A property that 
is about language metadata may have more than one value, since it aims 
to describe all potential users of the information</p>

<p>The <dfn id="tpl">text-processing language</dfn> is the language of a 
particular range of text (which could be a whole resource or just part 
of it). A property that represents the text-processing language needs 
to have a single value, because it describes the text content in such a 
way that tools such as spell-checkers, default font applicators, 
hyphenation and line breakers, case converters, voice browsers, and 
other language-sensitive applications know which set of rules or 
resources to apply to a specific range of text. Such applications 
generally need an unambiguous statement about the language they are 
working on.</p>

</section>

<section id="Language Tagging Use Cases">
  <h3>Language Tagging Use Cases</h3>
  <p>Kensuke is reading an old Tibetan manuscript from the Dunhuang 
	collection. The tool he is using to read the manuscript has access 
	to annotations created by scholars working in the various languages 
	of the International Dunhuang Project, who are commenting on the 
	text. The section of the manuscript he is currently looking at has 
	commentaries by people writing in Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. 
	Each of these commentaries is stored in a separate  annotation, but 
	the annotations point to the same point in the target document. 
	Each commentary is mainly written in the language of the scholar, 
	but may contain excerpts from the manuscript and other sources 
	written in Tibetan as well quoted text in Chinese and English. Some 
	commentaries may contain parallel annotations, each in a different 
	language. For example, there are some with the same text translated 
	into Japanese, Chinese and Tibetan.</p>
	
  <p>Kensuke speaks Japanese, so he generally wants to be presented with the 
    Japanese commentary.</p>
 <section>
   <h4 id="language_metadata">Capturing the language of the audience</h4>
   <p>The annotations containing the Japanese commentary have a <code class="kw" 
translate="no">language</code> property set to &quot;<code class="kw" 
translate="no">ja</code>&quot; (Japanese). The tool he is using knows that he 
     wants to read Japanese commentaries, and it uses this information to 
     select and present to him the text contained in that body.  This is 
     language information being used as metadata about the intended audience – it indicates to the 
     application doing the retrieval that the intended consumer of the 
    information  wants Japanese.</p>
    
   <p>Some of the annotations contain text in more than one language. 
   For example, there are several with commentary in  Chinese, Japanese 
   and Tibetan. For these annotations, it's appropriate to set the 
   <code class="kw" translate="no">language</code> property to 
   &quot;<code class="kw" translate="no">ja,zh,bo</code>&quot; – 
   indicating that both Japanese and Chinese readers may want to find 
   it.</p> <p>The language tagging that is happening here is likely to 
   be at the resource level, rather than the string level. It's 
   possible, however, that the text-processing language for strings 
   inside the resource may be assumed by looking at the resource level 
   language tag – but only if it is a single language tag. If the tag 
   contains &quot;ja,zh,bo&quot; it's not clear which strings are in 
   Japanese, which are in Chinese, and which are in Tibetan.</p>
 </section>

<section>
<h4 id="text_processing">Capturing the text-processing language</h4>  
  <p>Having identified the relevant annotation text to present to 
    Kensuke, his application has to then display it so that he can read it. 
    It's important to apply the correct font to the text. In the following 
    example, the first line is labeled <code class="kw">ja</code> 
    (<em>Japanese</em>), and the second <code class="kw">zh-Hant</code> (<em>Traditional 
    Chinese</em>) respectively. The characters on both lines are the same code points, but they demonstrate systematic differences between how those and similar codepoints are rendered in Japanese vs. Chinese fonts. It's important to associate the right forms with the right language, otherwise you can make the reader uncomfortable or possibly unhappy.</p>
  
  <p class="cjk-demo"><img src="images/ja_zh_fonts.png" alt="雪, 刃, 直, 令, 垔"/></p>
  <!--p class="cjk-demo"> 雪, 刃, 直, 令, 垔 </p>
  <p class="cjk-demo" lang="ja"> 雪, 刃, 直, 令, 垔 </p>
  <p class="cjk-demo" lang="zh-Hans"> 雪, 刃, 直, 令, 垔 </p>
  <p class="cjk-demo" lang="zh-Hant"> 雪, 刃, 直, 令, 垔 </p-->
  
  <p>So, it's important to apply a Japanese font to 
	the Japanese text that Kensuke is reading. There are also 
	language-specific differences in the way text is wrapped at the end 
	of a line. For these reasons we need to identify the actual 
	language of the text to which the font or the wrapping algorithm 
	will be applied.</p>
	
	<p>Another consideration that might apply is the use of 
	text-to-speech. A voice browser will need to know whether to use 
	Japanese or Chinese pronunciations, voices, and dictionaries for the ideographic characters 
	contained in the annotation body text.</p>
	
	<p>Various other text rendering or analysis tools need to know 
	the language of the text they are dealing with. Many different types of text processing depend on information about the language of the content in order to provide the proper processing or results and this goes beyond mere presentation of the text. For example, if Kensuke wanted to search for an annotation, the application might provide a full text search capability. In order to index the words in the annotations, the application would need to split the text according to word boundaries. In Japanese and Chinese, which do not use spaces in-between words, this often involves using dictionaries and heuristics that are language specific.</p>
    
    <p>We also need a way to indicate the change of language to Chinese and 
    Tibetan later in the commentary for some annotations, so that 
    appropriate fonts and wrapping algorithms can be applied there.

  <section id="languageApproaches">
    <h2>Approaches to Tagging Language</h2>

   <p>The main issue is how a <a>producer</a> of a string knows how to encode and a <a>consumer</a> of a 
  string will know how to find and interpret the language-related features that ought to be used for 
  that string when it is eventually processed or displayed to the user. A number of alternatives are considered below.</p>   
  
  <section id="langapproach1">
    <h2>Require HTML or XML for content</h2>
    
	<p>One proposal from members of the Annotation WG was to require 
	HTML/XML formats for such annotation bodies, and use the <code 
	class="kw" translate="no">lang</code> or <code class="kw" 
translate="no">xml:lang</code> attributes in markup to denote the 
    language changes. </p>
    
  </section>

  
  <section id="langapproach2">
    <h2>Create a new datatype in JSON-LD</h2>
    <p>If a new datatype were added to JSON to support natural language strings, then specifications could easily specify that type for use in document formats. Since the format is standardized, <a>producers</a> and <a>consumers</a> would not need to guess about direction or language information when it is encoded. Such a serialization might look like the following:</p>
    
    <pre>
myLocalizedString: "Hello World!"@en^ltr          // language and direction
myLocalizedString_fr: "Bonjour monde !"@fr        // language only
myLocalizedString_ar: "مرحبا بالعالم!"@ar-EG^rtl  // both language and direction information
myLocalizedString_und: "שלום עולם!"^rtl           // direction information only
myLanguageNeutralString: "978-0-123-4567-X"       // no language or direction for this non-natural-language string</pre>

  <p>The downside of adding a datatype is that JSON is a widely implemented format, including many ad-hoc implementations. Any new serialization form would likely break or cause interoperability problems with these existing implementations. JSON is not designed to be a "versioned" format. Any serialization form used would need to be transparent to existing JSON processors and thus could introduce unwanted data or data corruption to existing fields and formats.</p>
  </section>



<section id="langapproach3">
  <h2>Provide a "dictionary"</h2>
  <p>Provide a "dictionary" or canned pre-built extension that can be
  used commonly across a number of different document formats using
  the same base data format, such as JSON.</p>
</section>
<section id="unicodeTags">
  <h2>Unicode tag characters</h2> 
  
  <p>Unicode tag characters are strongly deprecated by the Unicode Consortium. We are unaware of any 
  implementations that interpret or understand them. These tag characters
  were intended for use in language tagging within plain text contexts
  and are often suggested as an alternate means of providing in-band
  non-markup language tagging.</p>

  <p>Here is how Unicode tags are supposed to work:</p>
  
  <p>A language tag is just one of the potential tags that could be 
  applied using this system, so each language tag begins with a tag 
  identification character, in this case U+E0001. The  remainder of the 
  Unicode  block for forming tags mirrors the printable ASCII 
  characters. That is, U+E0020 is space, U+E0041 is capital A, and so 
  forth. Following the tag identification character, you use them to 
  spell out a [[!BCP47]] language tag  using the upper/lowercase 
  letters, digits, and the hyphen character. ASCII tags can be 
  transmogrified into tags by adding 0xE0000 to each character's code 
  point. Additional structure, such as a language priority list (see 
  [[RFC4647]]) can be constructed using other characters such as comma 
  or semi-colon.</p>
  
  <p>Tag lengths, therefore, are a minimum of three characters, and can 
  easily be 12 or more. Furthermore, these characters are supplementary 
  characters. That is, they are encoded using 4-bytes per character in 
  UTF-8 and they are encoded as a surrogate pair (two 16-bit code 
  units) in UTF-16. Surrogate pairs are needed for languages such as 
  Java and JavaScript and the use of surrogates makes the strings 
  somewhat opaque. </p>
  
  <p>The end of a tag's scope is signalled by the end of the string, or 
  can be signalled explicitly using the cancel tag character U+E007F, 
  either alone (to cancel all tags) or preceeded by the language tag 
  identification character U+E0001 (i.e. the sequence 
  &lt;U+E0001,U+E007F&gt; to end only language tags).</p>
  
  <p>Applications that treat 
	the characters as unknown Unicode characters will display them as 
	tofu (hollow box replacement characters) and may count them towards 
	length limits, etc. So they are only useful when applications or 
	interchange mechanisms are fully aware of them and can remove them 
	or disregard them appropriately. Although the characters are not 
	supposed to be displayed or have any effect on text processing, in 
	practice they can interfere with normal text processes such as 
	truncation. line wrapping, hyphenation, spell-checking and so 
	forth.</p>
    
  <p>By design, [[!BCP47]] language tags are intended to be ASCII 
  case-insensitive. Applications handling Unicode tag characters would 
  have to apply similar case-insensitivity to ensure correct 
  identification of the language. (The Unicode data doesn't specify 
  case conversion pairings for these characters; this complicates the 
  processing and matching of langauge tag values encoded using the tag 
  characters.)</p>
  
  <p>Moreover, language tags need to be formed from valid subtags to 
  conform to [[!BCP47]]. Valid subtags are kept in an IANA registry and 
  new subtags are added regularly, so applications dealing with this 
  kind of tagging would need to always check each subtag against the 
  latest version of the registry.</p>
  
  <p>Another issue with these tag characters is that they do not allow 
  nesting of language tags. For example, if a string contains two 
  languages, such as a quote in French inside an English sentence, 
  Unicode tag characters can only indicate where one language starts. 
  To indicate nested languages, tags would need to be embedded into the 
  text not just prefixed to the front.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, although never implemented, other types of tags could be 
  embedded into a string or document using Unicode tag characters. It 
  is possible for these tags to overlap sections of text tagged with a 
  language tag.</p>

<h2>Direction tagging</h2>

<section id="Bidirectional Use Cases">
  <h3>Bidirectional Use Cases</h3> 
  
  <p>If your specification or application provides a way of correctly 
  displaying the following strings when they reach the point of display 
  to the user, you will have solved the majority of the problems. For 
  that to happen, there must be a way to tell  the required base 
  direction for each string.</p>
  
  <p>All examples show characters from left to right in the order they 
  are stored in memory. We use Hebrew text so as to avoid issues 
  related to the display of cursive characters in Arabic. We will also 
  use these tests as examples for the concepts on this page.</p>
  
  <p>Tests 1-4 need to be displayed using an RTL base direction. Test 5 
  needs to be displayed as LTR text.</p>
  
<section id="test1">
  <h4>Test #1</h4>
  <p dir="rtl" style="text-align:center;"><code><bdo dir="ltr">&quot;בינלאומי!&quot;</bdo></code>  </p>
  <p>For presentation to a user, the  characters above should be presented in the reverse order to what you see on this page. The Hebrew characters will be reversed by applying the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UBA). However, the UBA cannot make the exclamation mark appear to the left of the Hebrew text, where it belongs, unless the base direction is set to RTL.</p>
  <p>This is what the text of the string should look like if displayed correctly by a consumer:&nbsp; <img src="images/test1.png" alt="Test 1"/></p>

<section id="test2">
  <h4>Test #2</h4>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code>
    <bdo dir="ltr">&quot;bidi בינלאומי&quot;</bdo>
  </code></p>
  <p>For presentation to a user, the text &quot;bidi&quot; must appear to the right of the Hebrew letters.<code></code> The UBA cannot do this unless it knows that the overall base direction is RTL.</p>
  <p>This is what the text of the string should look like if displayed correctly by a consumer:&nbsp; <img src="images/test2.png" alt="Test 2"/></p>

  <h3>Test #3</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code><bdo dir="ltr">&quot;&lt;span&gt;בינלאומי!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;</bdo></code></p>
  <p>This test is intended for consuming applications that treat the markup in the string as actual markup. As for test #1, the exclamation mark must appear to the left of the Hebrew letters, regardless of the LTR directionality of the markup surrounding it.</p>
  <p>This is what the text of the string should look like if displayed correctly by a consumer:&nbsp; <img src="images/test1.png" alt="Test 3"/></p>

    <bdo dir="ltr">&quot;&lt;span dir='rtl'&gt;one שתיים three&lt;/span&gt;&quot;</bdo></code></p>
  <p>If the consuming application is expected to parse the markup as actual markup, the list in the element content above should be displayed to the user in the order &quot;three שתיים one&quot;.<code></code> This requires the UBA to know that the intended base direction of the string is RTL. The key point of this test is that the base direction information is carried in the markup.</p>

<section id="mainpoint">
  <h2>The main issue</h2>
  <p>The main issue is how  a consumer of a string will know what  base direction should be used for that string when it is eventually displayed to a user. A number of alternatives are considered below.</p>

</section>
<section id="firststrong">
  <h2>First-strong</h2>
  <p> First-strong detection looks for the first character with a strong Unicode directional property in a string, and sets the base direction to match it. Many developers assume that this provides a robust solution, but first-strong detection alone is not always adequate to communicate base direction.</p>
  <p>Note that, if the producer is relying  on the consumer using first-strong character detection to establish the contextual base direction of a string, the consumer  needs to be aware that it should also use that approach. Although first-strong detection is outlined in the UBA, it is not the only possible higher level protocol mentioned for detecting string direction. For example, Twitter and Facebook currently use different default heuristics for guessing the base direction of text – neither use just simple first-strong detection, and one uses a completely different method.</p>
  <p>The first-strong detection algorithm needs to skip characters at the start of the string that don't have a strong directional property.</p>
  <p>It also needs to skip embedded runs of text that are directionally isolated from the text around it, if it is to follow the UBA. Isolation may be achieved by Unicode formatting characters, such as RLI, LRI and FSI, or by markup in the string if that markup is to be interpreted as actual markup by the consumer (eg. &lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt; in HTML5).</p>
  <p>The principal problem encountered with first-strong detection is that the first strong character is not always representative of the base direction that needs to be applied to that string, such as in test #2 above.</p>
  <p>If a string contains markup that will be parsed by the consumer as markup, there are additional problems. Any such markup at the start of the string must also be skipped when searching for the first strong directional character. If, however, there is angle bracket content that is intended to be an <em>example</em> of markup, rather than actual markup, the markup must not be skipped. It isn't clear how a consumer of the string would know the difference between this case and the previous one.</p>
  <p>If parseable markup in the string contains information about the intended direction of the string, that information should be used rather than relying on first-strong heuristics. This is problematic in a couple of ways: (a) it assumes that the consumer of the string understands the semantics of the markup, which may be ok if there is an agreement between all parties to use, say, HTML markup only, but would be problematic, for example, when dealing with random XML vocabularies, and (b) the consumer must be able to  recognise and handle a situation where only the initial part of the string has markup, ie. the markup applies to an inline span of text rather than the string as a whole.</p>
  <p>If no strong directional character is found in the string, the direction should be assumed to be LTR.  </p>
  <p>The remaining sections look at ways that a string may be stored with additional information where text direction cannot be detected accurately by the first-strong method.</p>
</section>




<section id="rlm">
  <h2>Augmenting <q>first-strong</q> by inserting RLM markers</h2> 
  
  <p>It is possible for a producer of a string to attach an RLM or LRM 
  character to the beginning of the string when the wrong base 
  direction would otherwise be assumed by a process using a simple first-strong 
  heuristic. </p> 
  
  <p>If the producer is a human, they could theoretically apply one of 
  these characters when creating a string in order to signal the 
  directionality. One problem, especially on mobile devices, is the 
  availability or inconvenience of inputting an RLM/LRM character. In 
  addition, because the characters are invisible and because Unicode 
  bidi is complicated, it can be difficult for the user to know that a 
  bidi control will be necessary.</p> 
  
  <p>However, humans often do create text that will later become 
  strings in environments where the bidi algorithm will need help.  For 
  example, if a person types information into an HTML form and relies 
  on the form's base direction or use of shortcut keys to make the 
  string look correct in the form field, they would not need to add 
  RLM/LRM  to make the string 'look correct' for themselves, but 
  outside of that context the string would look incorrect unless an 
  appropriate strong character was added to it. Similarly, strings 
  scraped from a web page that has <code class="kw" 
  translate="no">dir=rtl</code> set in the <code class="kw" 
  translate="no">html</code> element would not normally have or need an 
  RLM/LRM character at the start of the string in HTML.</p> 
  
  <p>This approach is therefore only appropriate for 
  general use if it is acceptable to change the value of the string. 
  </p> 
  
  <p>Apart from changing the identity of the string, adding 
  characters to it may have an effect on things such as string length 
  or pointer positions, which may become problematic.</p> 
  
  <p>When inserting an LRM or RLM character, the consumer still depends on 
  applying a first-strong heuristic to get the proper direction; 
  consumers that don't apply first-strong can get the direction 
  wrong.</p> 
  
  <p>If directional information is contained in markup that will be 
  parsed as such by the consumer (for example, <code class="kw" 
  translate="no">dir=rtl</code> in HTML),  the producer  of the string 
  needs to understand that markup in order to set or not set an RLM/LRM 
  character as appropriate. If the producer always adds RLM/LRM to the 
  start of such strings, the consumer is expected to know that. If the 
  producer relies instead on the markup being understood, the consumer 
  is expected to understand the markup.</p> 
  
  <p>The producer of a string should not automatically apply RLM or LRM 
  to the start of the string, but  should test whether it is needed. 
  For example, if there's already an RLM there, no need to add another. 
  If the context is correctly conveyed by first-strong heuristics, no 
  need to add additional characters either. Note, however, that testing 
  whether supplementary directional information of this kind is needed 
  is only possible if the producer has access, and knows that it has 
  access, to the original context of the string.</p>
</section>




<section id="paired">
  <h2>Paired formatting characters</h2>
  <p>This approach inserts paired Unicode formatting characters at the start and end of a string to indicate the base direction. </p>
  <p>If paired formatting characters are used, they should be isolating, ie. starting with RLI, LRI, FSI, and not with RLE or LRE.</p>
  <p>However, It would not be enough to simply apply the UBA first-strong heuristics to such a string, because the Unicode bidi algorithm is unable to ascertain the base direction for a string that starts with RLI/LRI/FSI and ends with PDI. This is because the algorithm skips over isolated sequences and treats them  as a neutral character.  A consumer of the string would have to take special steps, in this case, to uncover the first-strong character. </p>
  <p>This approach is also only appropriate if it is acceptable to change the value of the string. In addition to possible issues  such as changed string length or pointer positions, this approach runs the risk of  one of the paired characters getting lost, either through handling errors, or through text truncation, etc.</p>
  <p>A  producer and a consumer of a string would need to recognise and handle a situation where a string begins with a paired formatting character but doesn't end with it  because the formatting characters only describe a part of the string. </p>
  <p>Unicode specifies a limit to the number of embeddings that are effective, and embeddings could build up over time to exceed that limit.</p>
  <p>Consuming applications would need to recognise and appropriately handle the isolating formatting characters. At the moment such support for RLI/LRI/FSI is not pervasive.</p>
</section>



<section id="metadata">
  <h2>Metadata</h2>
  <p>If it is possible to pass metadata with the string and the consumer knows how to retrieve the meaning of that metadata, this can provide a simple, effective and efficient method of communicating the intended base direction without affecting the actual content of the string.</p>
  <p>Metadata not only removes the problem of whether or not, and how, to parse markup in a string to determine the direction, but even in the simplest strings, without markup, it avoids the need to inspect and run heuristics on the string to determine its base direction.</p>
  <p>There needs to be metadata available for each individual string. Alternatively, metadata can be inherited, but some mechanism must be available to override the inherited direction for a particular string which differs in direction from the inherited value.  </p>
  <p>Metadata is probably most effective, however (especially for the original creator of the strings), if it is only passed with a string in those cases where first-strong detection is otherwise going to produce a wrong result. This would mean that consumers of strings should not only recognise the metadata, but should also expect to  rely on first-strong heuristics for strings without metadata. It also means that producers of strings need to recognise situations where directional information is needed and set the metadata.</p>
